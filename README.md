## What is Wayline?

Wayline is a free, non-profit project that was created to be the replacement for all travel, maps and transit apps. It has functionalities most other apps charge for, does not track any data, and is open source and maintained by the community (mostly Zoe, creator and main developer).

## Unique Features

When I decided to create Wayline, I had a clear idea in my mind of some features I think it deserved and other apps lacked. Here are some!

- Shade routes: When you choose a route, Wayline takes into account the time of day and a 3D model of the buildings around you to try to calculate a route that doesn't leave you right in the sun for too long. You can always choose the "classic" route if you don't mind dying at the sun :D.

- Speed up walking routes: Wayline will use your current walking speed and will recalculate your route to make sure the estimated time of arrival is as accurate as possible. In addition, you can set a custom walking speed in the settings if you want to plan ahead.

- User-reported issues and data: We use a custom database for all of our stops and routes, which gives us extra control over our data. Users can add missing routes or stops (and also extra information about them like accessibility or shelter) and report issues with existing ones. In the future, we might also implement an automatic anonymous system that reports real-time issues like delays, closures and arrival ETAs.

## Privacy

We don't track or store any data. If you want to know more about our privacy policy, please check our [Privacy Policy](https://privacy.wayline.info).
